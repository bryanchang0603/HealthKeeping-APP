People are becoming more concerned about their health as their living standard increase. There are some health keeping apps currently in the market, but the functions are separated. For receiving a complete health advice. What our group want to do is to develop a integrated healthing keeping app that can help the user obtain all the required health information in the least time and provide a online community that allow the people to discuss and share their life during this covid period.
